# Sherpa

Sherpa is an open-source project designed to facilitate in school selection for the Delaware Public School System. Sherpa is designed to offer three sections: Learn, Search and Apply. 

The Learn section will allow for parents to learn about the Sherpa project and how to use the software.

The Search section will allow parents to search for nearby schools and learn more about them with an advanced search section.

The Apply section will allow parents to apply to a school.
